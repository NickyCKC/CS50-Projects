                <h2>Anglican High School</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>At the age of 9, I started watching basketball for the first time.</p>
                <p>I was amazed by the Heats VS Mavericks <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr> match</p>
                <p>Ever since then, I have been playing basketball outside on my free time for fun</p>
                <p>With no offical training before, I managed to get accepted to a school</p>
                <p>with a long and rich history in basketball.</p>
                <p>Little did I know how intense and demanding their trainings were as I struggled as a beginner.</p>
                <p>After 1 year of training, I managed to clinch the title of Vice-captain, giving me the motivation to push my limits.</p>
                <p>My role on the team was the power forward as a had I larger build compared to my teammates.</p>
                <p>My skills slowly grew as I gritted teeth through the tough trainings.</p>
                <p>By the time I graduated, I walked away with 3 First Runner-up medals for the 4 annual seasons I took part in.</p>
                <p></p>

                <hr>
                <p>During my final year in Anglican High, I was persuaded to join Kai Xuan,</p>
                <p>an external basketball club with strong roots to Christianity.</p>
                <p>It was during their trainings that my skill cap increased as I had more opportunities</p>
                <p>to shoot long range shots and dribble the ball more.</p>
                <p>I only stayed in the club for 1 year and lost</p>
                <p>in the only competition I took part in.</p>

                <h2>Raffles Institution</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>When I joined this school at the age of 17,</p>
                <p>I knew the team was going to struggle during competitions</p>
                <p>as there were no tall people to play centers or power forwards.</p>
                <p>I was the only one playing the center position, which wasn't my strongest position on court.</p>
                <p>The first season ended abruptly as we lost two crucial matches by a few points only.</p>
                <p>It was a tough loss to take as I knew we had the potential to become the champs that year.</p>
                <p>The following year, I got elected as the Vice-captian once again, but my teammates that I had</p>
                <p>were mostly the ones who weren't selected for the first year's team so they were lacking in a few areas</p>
                <p>I quickly enforced discipline and taught the weaker ones how to become better.</p>
                <p>Within a few months time, the whole team had reliable players, ready to step-up when needed.</p>
                <p>Although we didn't get to play a season in 2020 due to COVID-19,</p>
                <p>we still managed to play friendly matches with local schools before the pandemic.</p>
                <p>We destroyed every team who played agaisnt us,</p>
                <p>and I was so proud to see how far my team has grown in a few short months.</p>
                <p>If we played in season that year, I am confident we would make it to the Finals!</p>
